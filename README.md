# Software Testing using Selenium

This project demonstrates automation testing for an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver. It includes functional testing and unit testing for common functionalities such as product search, adding to cart, and checkout processes. The project is designed to ensure that the website works as expected by simulating user actions in the browser.

## Features

- **Automated Functional Tests**: Test key functionalities of an e-commerce site (e.g., product search, add to cart, checkout).
- **Unit Testing**: Test specific modules to ensure the correctness of isolated functions.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatically captures screenshots on test failures for easier debugging.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports after each test run.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation and testing.
- **Python**: Main programming language for writing test scripts.
- **Unittest**: Python's built-in unit testing framework.
- **PyTest**: Testing framework for running Selenium tests with enhanced capabilities.
- **Allure**: For generating detailed test reports.




### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- ChromeDriver (or the appropriate WebDriver for your browser)
- Allure for generating test reports


## Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional browsers such as Firefox and Edge.
- Implement test case parameterization for testing with different input values.
- Include database validation to verify data correctness after each test case.
- Integrate with Jenkins for continuous testing.
